# Day 2: Morning

**Copy examples across**

## Structure of Day

- OOP

## OOP
- So far everything procedural
- Need state in bigger apps
- Object-Oriented Programming is one solution
- Encapsulation: keep related properties and methods in one places
- Black boxes passing messages
- PHP wasn't really OO until 2009, hence older systems/libraries

### Classes
- We can use classes/objects to store related data
    - `sendMail($to, $from, $message)` function - but need more options
    - `sendMail()` using globals - yuck
    - `Mail->send()` using an object
- Need to start using objects somewhere, bootstrap file - get stuff going and include autoload

### Types
- An object of class X, can be thought of has being the X type
- Type declaration in methods/functions
- e.g. `MailingList->sendWith(Mail $mail)`
- Try sending in wrong sort of thing
- Not much good, as limited to `Mail` class

### Polymorphism
- What if we want `Mail` and `MailChimp`?
- Two classes have *enough* in common to be used in a specific context
- Inheritance
- Interfaces

### Inheritance
- `Mailer` parent class: with `to()` and `from()`, other two inherit and add `send()`
- Update `MailingList` to use `Mailer`
- But could instance `Mailer` or create child with no `send()` method
- Abstract classes: make `Mailer` abstract
- Overriding the `to()` method in `MailChimp`
- Using `parent::` to call parent class
- Intuitive appeal of inheritance: `Anmial`, `Mammal`, `Primate`, `Person`

### Interfaces
- Create `MailerInterface`
- Update `MailingList`
- Class can implement multiple interfaces, only have one parent
- Message passing: methods and parameters - proper encapsulation
- Inheritance often means knowing about inside of an object


### Inheritance Tax
- Most books focus on inheritance
- Ok to inherit from library classes, they do most the work
- Don't start with an abstract class, write at least three classes that share identical code before using inheritance
- The `Mammal` class actually kind of useless
- Composition over inheritance: use interfaces and shared classes
- Law of Demeter
