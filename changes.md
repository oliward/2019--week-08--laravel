## To Do

- More detail in HTTP/API chapters
- API design needn't reflect database structure
- Guide to writing classes
    * [ ] Does it accept arguments: __construct
    * [ ] Does it need default values?
    * [ ] What methods does it need?
- Type hinting arrays, scalars
- Better static property example in script
- Mention use partial namespace with `use` - e.g. `App\Cutlery` so you can then do `new Cutlerty\Spoon()`
- Talk about `unsigned()` integers in foreign key stuff
- Split Namespaces and Libraries into two parts
- Cover "boostrap" file in more detail in Namespaces
- Rewrite notes on autoloading - which file it goes in, etc.
- `lastName` method used in static section of notes, but not actually in Person class (p. 15)

## Doing

    * [x] Classes
    * [ ] Namespaces/Composer
    * [ ] OOP

- Update all increments to bigIncrements and releated foreign keys
- Consistent backend/frontend usage
    > Sometimes back-end, sometimes backend
- Mention no point have private methods in interfaces
- Mention `migrate:refresh` and `migrate:fresh`
- Faker library: can use to generate people for challenges
    * [x] Update notes

    * [x] Change wording on Tricksy challenge 01/02
- Update 01/02 Books namespace to Library
